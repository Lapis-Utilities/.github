## Lapis Utilities

### Who are we? ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lapis Utilities is a organization that helps people in the MCBE community. 

We made repositories to help others in the MCBE community like...

üõ°Ô∏è 1. [**Lapis Automod**](https://github.com/Lapis-Utilities/Lapis-Automod) is a automod to protect your realm from attacks. This can be buggy and only good node.js users that know node.js well is only recommended to use this. Common sense of MongoDB is also needed to use Lapis Automod. *This is still in active development.*

üî´ 2. [**BDS Protocol Hunter**](https://github.com/Lapis-Utilities/BDS-Protocol-Hunter) finds the latest BDS protocol version for you to use when you can't update Minecraft to find it yourself and such.

Our list may not be big to you, but it is to *us!*
